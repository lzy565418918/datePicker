### How to use
This is based on a picker component based on the mand-mobile framework. I customize the contents of the selector. When I click the popup selector, the date of the day is selected by default. When the year is switched, the month and day are unchanged. "At the time, the month and day automatically become "all", the minimum date and the maximum date can be set by themselves. The current minimum date is set on January 1, 2016, and the maximum date is set to the day.
